# breathe: peripheral breath trainer ðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨

Breathe is a (distraction-free) peripheral breath trainer, it helps you breathe correctly so you can stay calm and focus on what matters. Breathe's window is small and it always stays on top so you can look at it peripherally, while doing other stuff.

## Motivation
I did this 5 minute project after reading some articles on how breathing correctly can help you focus and can calm you. I don't expect this to work for everyone but it does indeed work for me. Some of the articles:

## Installation

### Mac

### Linux

Right now breathe doesn't run on linux but [@amar-laksh](https://github.com/amar-laksh) provided an awesome KISS solution:

- Install imv: https://github.com/eXeC64/imv (really lightweight viewer)
- Download this gif breathe.gif: https://quietkit.com/img/box-breathing-4x-v03.gif
- run imv breathe.gif
- Set it to a custom shortcut and press q to close window.
